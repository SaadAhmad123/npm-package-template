## Steps to Publish Your Package

To get your package from development to publication smoothly, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Classic NPM Auth Token**:
   - Navigate to your NPM account and generate an authentication token specifically for publishing packages. This token is crucial for the next steps in the automated deployment process.

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository's settings.
   - Navigate to the 'Secrets' section.
   - Add your NPM authentication token as a new secret with the name `NPM_TOKEN`. This allows GitHub Actions to securely access your NPM account for publishing the package.

3. **Develop and Test Your Package**:
   - Use this template as a starting point to develop your package.
   - Ensure to test thoroughly to maintain high-quality standards.

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Once your package is ready and tested, push your changes to GitHub. The configured GitHub Actions will automatically handle the process of publishing your package to NPM, using the provided `NPM_TOKEN`.

5. **Automated Publishing**:
   - With the push to GitHub, your package will be automatically published to NPM, making it available for the broader community.
